# ROI Calculator for RedSight

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-28

## 1. Objective

This document provides a simplified model for calculating the Return on Investment (ROI) of the RedSight platform. The goal is to connect the platform's security benefits to a quantifiable business value.

## 2. Formula

The ROI is calculated based on the principle of Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE), a standard risk management formula.

**Formula:**
```
Annual Savings = (Baseline ALE) - (Reduced ALE)
ROI % = ((Annual Savings - Annual Platform Cost) / Annual Platform Cost) * 100
```

Where:
- **Baseline ALE** = `Estimated Annual Revenue of Asset * Baseline Probability of Exploit`
- **Reduced ALE** = `Estimated Annual Revenue of Asset * (Baseline Probability of Exploit * (1 - Probability Reduction))`

## 3. Input Variables

| Variable | Description | Example Value |
|---|---|---|
| **R (Annual Revenue)** | The estimated annual revenue generated by the asset being protected. | $6,000,000 |
| **p0 (Baseline Probability)** | The estimated annual probability of a successful exploit occurring *before* using RedSight. This is often the hardest to estimate and can be based on historical data or industry benchmarks. | 2% (0.02) |
| **p_reduction (Probability Reduction)** | The estimated percentage by which RedSight reduces the likelihood of an exploit, primarily by speeding up remediation. | 30% (0.30) |
| **C (Annual Cost)** | The total annual cost of the RedSight platform (licensing, infrastructure, and personnel). | $10,000 |

## 4. Example Calculation

This example uses the sample values from the table above.

### Step 1: Calculate Baseline Annual Loss
- `Baseline ALE = $6,000,000 * 0.02`
- **Baseline ALE = $120,000**

### Step 2: Calculate Reduced Annual Loss
- `Reduced ALE = $6,000,000 * (0.02 * (1 - 0.30))`
- `Reduced ALE = $6,000,000 * (0.02 * 0.70)`
- `Reduced ALE = $6,000,000 * 0.014`
- **Reduced ALE = $84,000**

### Step 3: Calculate Annual Savings
- `Annual Savings = $120,000 - $84,000`
- **Annual Savings = $36,000**

### Step 4: Calculate ROI
- `ROI % = (($36,000 - $10,000) / $10,000) * 100`
- `ROI % = ($26,000 / $10,000) * 100`
- `ROI % = 2.6 * 100`
- **ROI % = 260%**

### Conclusion
In this hypothetical scenario, the RedSight platform provides a **260% return on investment** by reducing the expected annual loss from security incidents by $36,000.

**Disclaimer:** These numbers are illustrative. The accuracy of the ROI calculation is highly dependent on the accuracy of the input variables, especially the baseline probability of an exploit.
