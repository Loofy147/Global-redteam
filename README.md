# Global Red Team Framework

This repository contains a comprehensive, multi-dimensional adversarial excellence methodology that transcends traditional testing to become a philosophical engineering discipline.

## Overview

The framework is a suite of advanced security testing tools designed to be orchestrated for comprehensive red team operations. It includes modules for:

*   **API Security Testing:** Tests for OWASP API Security Top 10 and beyond.
*   **Fuzz Testing:** A coverage-guided fuzzer inspired by AFL.
*   **Property-Based Testing:** Generates adversarial test cases to discover edge cases.
*   **Race Condition Detection:** Finds TOCTOU and concurrent execution vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6+
*   pip

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd global-redteam
    ```

2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

1.  Create a `config.json` file from the example template:
    ```bash
    cp config.json.example config.json
    ```

2.  Edit `config.json` to match your target environment. At a minimum, you should set the `api_url` and `auth_token`.

### Usage

The `red_team_orchestrator.py` script is the main entry point for running the test suites.

**Run all test suites:**

```bash
python3 red_team_orchestrator.py --suites all
```

**Run specific test suites:**

```bash
python3 red_team_orchestrator.py --suites api fuzz
```

**Available test suites:**

*   `api`: API Security Testing
*   `fuzz`: Fuzz Testing
*   `property`: Property-Based Testing
*   `race`: Race Condition Detection

**Override configuration with command-line arguments:**

```bash
python3 red_team_orchestrator.py --api-url https://my-api.com --auth-token my-secret-token
```

## Reports

The orchestrator generates the following reports:

*   **Console Output:** Executive and technical summaries are printed to the console.
*   `red_team_findings.json`: A detailed JSON report of all findings.
*   `red_team_findings.csv`: A CSV export of all findings.
