# Penetration Test Report: [WebApp Name]

- **Report Date:** 2025-10-28
- **Testing Period:** [Start Date] to [End Date]
- **Lead Tester:** Jules, Global Red Team
- **Target:** [WebApp URL or IP Range]

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1. Overview
The Global Red Team conducted a penetration test against the **[WebApp Name]**. The engagement focused on identifying security vulnerabilities from the perspective of a motivated attacker and assessing the overall security posture of the application.

The assessment revealed **[Number]** vulnerabilities, including **[Number]** rated as **Critical** and **[Number]** rated as **High**. The key findings indicate a significant risk of **[e.g., unauthorized data access, account takeover, server compromise]**.

### 1.2. Key Findings
- **[Critical Finding 1, e.g., SQL Injection in Admin Panel]**
- **[Critical Finding 2, e.g., Broken Authentication on User API]**
- **[High Finding 1, e.g., Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)]**

### 1.3. Risk Assessment
The overall risk to the application is **HIGH**. The combination of critical vulnerabilities provides a clear path for an attacker to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data.

### 1.4. Recommendations
We recommend that the development team immediately prioritize the remediation of all **Critical** and **High** severity findings. A detailed remediation plan is provided in the **Security Roadmap** document.

## 2. Technical Findings

### 2.1. [CRITICAL] SQL Injection in Admin User Search
- **ID:** VULN-001
- **Severity:** **CRITICAL** (CVSS: 9.8)
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/admin/users`
- **CWE:** CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')

#### Description
The search functionality in the admin panel is vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker can manipulate the `q` parameter to execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing them to bypass authentication and exfiltrate all data from the database.

#### Proof of Concept (PoC)
The following request was sent to the server. The payload `' OR '1'='1` is a classic tautology that alters the SQL query to return all records.

**Request:**
```http
GET /api/admin/users?q=%27%20OR%20%271%27%3D%271 HTTP/1.1
Host: [WebApp URL]
Authorization: Bearer [Valid Admin JWT]
```

**Result:**
The API returned a complete list of all users in the database, demonstrating that the injection was successful.

#### Remediation
Implement parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions. This ensures that user-supplied input is treated as data and not as executable code.

### 2.2. [CRITICAL] Authentication Bypass on User API
- **ID:** VULN-002
- **Severity:** **CRITICAL** (CVSS: 9.1)
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/users/{user_id}`
- **CWE:** CWE-287: Improper Authentication

#### Description
The API endpoint for retrieving user information does not properly validate authentication tokens. An attacker can access any user's data by simply omitting the `Authorization` header or supplying an invalid token.

#### Proof of Concept (PoC)
The following request was sent without an `Authorization` header:

**Request:**
```http
GET /api/users/2 HTTP/1.1
Host: [WebApp URL]
```

**Result:**
The API responded with the full JSON object for user with ID `2`, including sensitive information. The same result was achieved by providing an invalid token (e.g., `Bearer invalid`).

#### Remediation
Enforce strict authentication and authorization checks on all API endpoints that handle sensitive data. Deny access by default and validate the signature and expiration of all JWTs on every request.

### 2.3. [MEDIUM] Lack of API Rate Limiting
- **ID:** VULN-003
- **Severity:** **MEDIUM** (CVSS: 5.3)
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/login`
- **CWE:** CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling

#### Description
The login endpoint does not have any rate limiting controls. This makes it vulnerable to brute-force and credential-stuffing attacks, which could lead to account takeovers and denial-of-service.

#### Proof of Concept (PoC)
A script was used to send 50 login requests in under a second. All 50 requests were processed successfully by the server, indicating no rate limiting is in place.

**Test Results:**
```
- Total Requests: 50
- Successful Requests: 50
- Requests per Second (RPS): ~200
```

#### Remediation
Implement a robust rate-limiting strategy (e.g., token bucket) for all sensitive and unauthenticated endpoints. Return an HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` error code when the limit is exceeded.

## 3. Methodology

This assessment utilized a combination of automated scanning and manual testing techniques. The Global Red Team Framework was used to perform:
- **API Security Testing (DAST):** Automated testing for common API vulnerabilities (OWASP API Top 10).
- **Coverage-Guided Fuzzing:** Automated generation of malformed inputs to test for crashes and unexpected behavior.
- **Manual Verification:** All findings were manually verified to confirm exploitability and assess their business impact.

## 4. Appendix

### 4.1. Risk Rating Scale

| Severity | CVSS Score | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | 9.0 - 10.0 | Immediate, direct path to compromise. |
| **High** | 7.0 - 8.9 | Significant impact, difficult to exploit. |
| **Medium** | 4.0 - 6.9 | Provides information or could be chained. |
| **Low** | 0.1 - 3.9 | Best practice or informational. |
