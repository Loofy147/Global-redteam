# Actionable Security Roadmap

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Target System:** Vulnerable Flask App (Production API v2.0)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a prioritized security roadmap to address the vulnerabilities identified during the recent Red Team assessment. The goal is to provide development teams with a clear, actionable plan to remediate weaknesses, improve the overall security posture, and track progress over time.

## 2. Priority Definitions

| Priority | SLA | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **P0 - Critical** | **7 Days** | Critical vulnerabilities that pose an immediate and severe risk to the system, its data, and the business. These often represent a direct path to compromise and require immediate attention. |
| **P1 - High** | **30 Days** | High-risk vulnerabilities that are difficult to exploit but could have a significant impact if successful. Remediation should be a high priority. |
| **P2 - Medium**| **90 Days** | Medium-risk vulnerabilities that provide attackers with valuable information or could be combined with other weaknesses. These should be addressed in the next development cycle. |
| **P3 - Low** | **180 Days** | Low-risk issues and best-practice recommendations that should be addressed when time permits. |

## 3. P0 - Critical Remediation (Target: Next 7 Days)

### P0.1: Fix Systemic Authentication Bypasses
- **Vulnerabilities:** `broken_auth`
- **Description:** Multiple critical endpoints, including login, admin, and user data APIs, can be accessed without valid authentication. This is a complete failure of a primary security control.
- **Action Items:**
    - **[Ticket: SEC-101]** Implement a mandatory, centralized authentication middleware that is applied to all API endpoints by default.
    - **[Ticket: SEC-102]** Enforce strict validation of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), including signature verification, expiration (`exp`), and algorithm (`alg`). Reject tokens using the `none` algorithm.
    - **[Ticket: SEC-103]** Create a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests to validate all authentication failure scenarios.
- **Team:** Core Backend Team
- **Verification:** All endpoints must return a `401 Unauthorized` error when accessed without a valid token.

### P0.2: Remediate Injection Flaws
- **Vulnerabilities:** `injection`
- **Description:** Admin and search endpoints are vulnerable to SQL, command, and LDAP injection, allowing for data exfiltration and remote code execution.
- **Action Items:**
    - **[Ticket: SEC-104]** Refactor all database queries to use a secure Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) or, at a minimum, parameterized queries (prepared statements). No raw SQL queries should be constructed with user input.
    - **[Ticket: SEC-105]** Implement server-side input validation and sanitization for all user-controllable data.
- **Team:** API Platform Team
- **Verification:** Automated SAST and DAST scans must be configured to detect injection flaws. Manual code review must confirm the absence of string-formatted queries.

## 4. P1 - High Remediation (Target: Next 30 Days)

### P1.1: Enforce Strict Function-Level Authorization
- **Vulnerabilities:** `broken_function_auth`
- **Description:** Unauthorized users can access sensitive administrative functions, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Action Items:**
    - **[Ticket: SEC-106]** Implement a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.
    - **[Ticket: SEC-107]** Add a permission check to every sensitive API endpoint to ensure the authenticated user has the required role to perform the requested action.
- **Team:** Core Backend Team
- **Verification:** Integration tests must be created to confirm that users with standard privileges receive a `403 Forbidden` error when attempting to access admin-only functions.

## 5. P2 - Medium Remediation (Target: Next 90 Days)

### P2.1: Implement API Rate Limiting
- **Vulnerabilities:** `rate_limiting`
- **Description:** The absence of rate limiting makes the application vulnerable to denial-of-service and credential-stuffing attacks.
- **Action Items:**
    - **[Ticket: SEC-108]** Implement a token bucket or sliding window rate-limiting strategy for all public-facing and authenticated endpoints.
    - **[Ticket: SEC-109]** Configure stricter limits for sensitive actions like login and password reset.
- **Team:** Infrastructure / SRE Team
- **Verification:** Automated tests must confirm that the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` error after the configured threshold is exceeded.

### P2.2: Harden Security Headers
- **Description:** The application is not currently using recommended HTTP security headers.
- **Action Items:**
    - **[Ticket: SEC-110]** Implement `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP), `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS), and `X-Content-Type-Options` headers.
- **Team:** Frontend / Web Platform Team
- **Verification:** Verify the presence and correctness of these headers using browser developer tools or online security scanners.

## 6. Long-Term Security Initiatives

- **Automated Security Testing:** Integrate the Red Team framework into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for regressions and new vulnerabilities before they reach production.
- **Developer Security Training:** Conduct mandatory secure coding training for all engineers, focusing on the OWASP Top 10.
- **Security Champions Program:** Establish a program to embed security expertise within each development team.
